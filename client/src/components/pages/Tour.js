            This temple is one of the most beautiful that Thailand has to offer,
            the name Wat Benchamabophit means Marble Temple and came about from
            the white Carrara marble that was imported from Italy and used to
            construct the temple. The temple is made up of various small
            buildings rather than one central wihaan or chedi. You can see many
            European influences in the temple including the beautiful stained
            glass windows. The Current king of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej spent
            several days as monk here before his coronation.
